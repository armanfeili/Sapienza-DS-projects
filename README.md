I am a Data Scientist and Full-Stack Developer with over four years of experience building scalable, ML-driven applications that integrate machine learning with modern web technologies. Currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome, I have worked in fields such as federated learning, bioinformatics, and cloud-native development. I will soon begin a 6-month thesis at CINECA on “AI-Powered Natural Language Query for Databases.” I am open to job opportunities and paid internships alongside my thesis.

**Key Skills:**

* Python, Deep Learning (CNNs, Self-Supervised), NLP, Scikit-learn, Federated Learning
* Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, Feature Engineering, Network Analysis
* Web Development: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Next.js, Node.js, REST APIs
* Databases & DevOps: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Flask
* Other: Web Scraping, Overleaf, MS Office, Blockchain
* Languages: English (B2), Italian (A1), Persian (Native)

## Repository Overview

This repository collects my coursework, projects, and reports across data science, algorithms, cloud computing, computer vision, IoT, and bioinformatics. It is organized into folders by course or topic, with each containing relevant notebooks, code, and supporting materials.


## Structure

* **Algorithms**: Homeworks and scripts for the Algorithms for Data Mining (ADM) course. Includes Python scripts, command line tasks, and homework solutions.
* **Bioinformatics**: Final project and results for Network Medicine and bioinformatics assignments.
* **Cloud\_Computing**: Source code and configuration files for cloud computing projects, including Kubernetes deployments, backend APIs, and frontend code.
* **Computer\_Vision**: Projects and presentations focused on computer vision and deep learning.
* **Fundamental\_of\_Data\_Science**: Final project, report, and main notebook for foundational data science coursework.
* **Novartis\_Datathon\_2024**: Code, data, and documentation related to the Novartis Datathon 2024 challenge.
* **Smart-Environment-IOT**: Reports, presentations, and code related to smart environments and IoT, including implementations of diffusion models.
* **Statistical\_Learning**: Final projects and homework for the Statistical Learning course, including code for diffusion models, conformal prediction, and age/gender estimation.
* **Summer\_Camp**: Materials, solutions, and code from summer teaching camps.


## Notes

* All code is in Python (with some shell scripts for command-line tasks).
* Many projects require Google Colab Pro or a GPU runtime for reasonable performance.
* Each subfolder usually contains its own `README.md` with additional project-specific details and instructions.

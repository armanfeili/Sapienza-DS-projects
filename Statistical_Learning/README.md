# Statistical Learning

## Overview

This repository contains two independent projects for the Statistical Learning course, both focused on generative modeling and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification:

1. **Final Project:**
   Investigates the reliability of conformal prediction intervals for age estimation on synthetic face images generated by a fine-tuned diffusion model. The workflow uses the UTKFace dataset, custom neural networks for age and gender prediction, and Stable Diffusion v1.5 for face generation. Results highlight the robustness of conformal prediction for most adult ages and explore the challenges with rare demographic combinations.

2. **Final Homework:**
   Implements and benchmarks a linear diffusion generative model for MNIST digit images, enhanced with KernelPCA for nonlinear latent encoding and conformal prediction for classification uncertainty. The notebook is optimized for modularity and reproducibility on Colab, with full parameterization and caching for experimentation.

## Running the Projects

Both projects are designed for Google Colab:

* Clone or open the relevant Colab notebook.
* Follow the provided setup instructions to install dependencies and mount Google Drive.
* Download required datasets (UTKFace or MNIST as indicated).
* Run the cells to preprocess data, train models, fine-tune generative components, and evaluate conformal predictors.
* Results (plots, tables, metrics) are saved to your Google Drive workspace.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Core ML libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, diffusers, transformers
* Google Colab Pro (recommended for GPU)

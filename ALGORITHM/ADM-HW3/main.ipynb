    "## 7. Algorithmic Question\n",
    "Leonardo is an intern at a company. He is paid based on the total number of hours he has worked. They agreed d days ago that Leonardo could not work less than \"mintime\" or more than \"maxtime\" hours per i-th day. Furthermore, he was warned by HR that on his last day at the company, he should provide a detailed report on how many hours he worked each day for the previous d days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is the day Leonardo should report to HR, but the problem is that he didn't account for how many hours he put in for each day, so he only has the total sum of the hours (sumHours) he put in total in these d days. He believes that if he creates a report in which each number \"daysHours\" corresponds to the total hours he worked on the i-th day while satisfying the HR limitations and the total sum of all \"daysHours\"  equals \"sumHours\" he would be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "He cannot create such a report independently and requests your assistance. He will give you the number of days \"d\" , total hours spent \"sumHours\" , and the HR limitations for each day \"i\"\n",
    ", and he wants you to assist him in determining whether it is possible to create such a fake report. If that is possible, make such a report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of input contains two integers d,  \"sumHours\"- the number of days Leonardo worked there and the total number of hours he worked for the company. Each of the following d lines contains two integer numbers \"mintime\" and \"maxtime\"- the minimum and maximum hours he can work on the \"i\"'th day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "If such a report cannot be generated, print 'NO' in one output line. If such a report is possible, print 'YES' in the output and d numbers - the number of hours Leonardo spent each day - in the second line. If more than one solution exists, print any of them."

    "Creating day_limits List(the next 6lines):The loop that fills the day_limits list iterates d times, and as we know the d is the number of days Leonardo worked. In each iteration, it performs a constant number of operations. Therefore, the time complexity of this part is O(d) and because days are a few it will be the same as o(\"a small number like=4\").\n",

    "Generating All Combinations of the given intervals: we are using the product function from the itertools module to generate all combinations of hours for each day. The number of combinations is tied to the number of options for each day. In the worst case scenario, this results in a total of (max-min+1)^d combinations. The time complexity of generating all combinations is O((max-min+1)^d), where max and min are the maximum and minimum hours for a day, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "regarding the optimality of my code, it can be optimal just for a few entered days(d).Due to the fact that it has an exponential time complexity, it is not optimal for big numbers of \"d\". Let me elaborate on my response: at the very first attempts, i decided to do this assignment with many different loops to get the answer. but my code had problems in its algorithm which just checked two successive days and it was not correct.then I googled my question to see how I could go through a list of some tuples to find the SumHour out of each element of these nested tuples in an optimal way. I figured out that this problem should be resolved by implementing a Greedy Algorithm... I searched about it and got into its functionality. Afterward, using the Greedy algorithm, I came up with an algorithm that worked But just printed out one soulution and also i was not worked for all inputs and as it was mentioned in the question,the code has to print all the possible solutions to this problem and not just one solution.ultimately,i came up with this algorithm which can be turned into a more optimal by using greedy and recursive form of algorithms at the same time to generate the right report and print all the possible outcomes but it is not working for some inputs.. i just mention it but i still believe on my algorithm for thorough and correct answer than this one which i wrote by the help of CHatGPT."
